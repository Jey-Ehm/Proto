# BatSafeU

### Introduction

#### What the project does?
An emergency response application that will lessen the workload of reporting any possible threats, and incidents that may occur around the Batangas State University Alangilan Campus. 

BatSafeU will be a tool for individuals around the whole campus. An application tool that can easily go through all the process of reporting without wasting time, cost, and less effort. With just a few clicks of a button, the main goal or purpose of the app will be accomplished.  To illustrate the concepts discussed in this section, we will examine a real-world example of an incident that was happening last year where a lot of students of Batangas State University are being targeted by people that have bad intentions, such as getting kidnapped and even might have stolen something from them. This example highlights the safety of the users of the application and provides insight into why the proponents proposed system might resolve such happenings. By analyzing this example, we can better understand the implications of BatSafeU application and gain a deeper understanding of its impact on the security and safety of all users.
