# BatSafeU

### Introduction

>> BatSafeU will be a tool for individuals around the whole campus. An application tool that can easily go through all the process of reporting without wasting time, cost, and less effort. With just a few clicks of a button, the main goal or purpose of the app will be accomplished.  To illustrate the concepts discussed in this section, we will examine a real-world example of an incident that was happening last year where a lot of students of Batangas State University are being targeted by people that have bad intentions, such as getting kidnapped and even might have stolen something from them. This example highlights the safety of the users of the application and provides insight into why the proponents proposed system might resolve such happenings. By analyzing this example, we can better understand the implications of BatSafeU application and gain a deeper understanding of its impact on the security and safety of all users. 

To create a conducive learning and working environment, it's essential for everyone on campus, including students, faculty, and staff, to feel secure. A mobile application that can report incidents, has a panic button feature, and allows users to request assistance can be a valuable tool to enhance campus safety. The application, which is named "BatSafeU," appropriately highlights its purpose of promoting safety on campus.

Introducing the BatSafeU mobile application can enhance the current safety measures and provide a well-rounded safety solution. With its incident reporting feature, the app enables students and campus personnel to promptly report any safety incidents, including crimes, accidents, or other related issues.
To summarize, incorporating the BatSafeU mobile application can make a substantial difference in enhancing the safety of students and campus personnel. The application features can work together to provide a comprehensive safety solution that complements the existing measures and serves to promote lesser incidents and crimes on and off campus.

### Significance of the Proposed Project
Emergency can be deﬁned as a sudden or unpredicted situation that can affect health or the environment itself. This study will have an action to prevent or lessen it. In most campuses there are services associated with each of the identiﬁed risks in order to respond to each kind of emergency, usually ﬁreﬁghters, police and medical emergency. To trigger the necessary means to help in an emergency situation it is required that the emergency situation is reported to the authorities and there is a service capable of receiving the request and ensuring the allocation of the necessary resources for assistance. By developing the emergency application it can help improve the emergency response especially in the Alangilan campus. The study can support the growth of safety enhancement within campus of the University.

This study will benefit the following individuals involved in such ways.
**Incident Management Team (IMT)**. The system will help them to fully monitor and take action about the incidents that will and might happen in the future. 

**Students**. This will provide students with quick access to emergency services, such on-campus safety or medical emergency services. This can ensure that students get the assistance they require as soon as possible.

**Staff**. For campus staff members, an emergency response app can be a useful tool that will enable them to act swiftly and efficiently in the event of an emergency. This can protect everyone's safety on campus and lessen the effects of any emergency situation.

Overall, this study can significantly impact the response in such unfortunate events by developing a reliable, and efficient emergency response application. The development of such applications can meet the incidents that may happen in the Alangilan campus to promote reliability and sustainable development. The implementation of strategies will enhance and smoothen the security and the user experience itself.
